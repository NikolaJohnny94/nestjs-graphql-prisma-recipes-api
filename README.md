## Overview üìú

The Recipes API is a server-side application built using modern, robust technologies (**Nest.js**, **GraphQL**, **Prisma**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**) to provide a scalable and efficient solution for managing recipes. It offers functionality for **creating**, **reading**, **updating**, **deleting** (**CRUD**), **searching** recipes and **authentication**, with a strong emphasis on **security**, and efficient data management.

Nest.js provides a modular architecture, making it easy to organize and maintain the codebase.<br/>
<img src='https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2107/PNG/64/file_type_graphql_icon_130564.png' width='26px'> [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - A query language and runtime for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need. GraphQL provides a flexible and efficient way to interact with the API, supporting nested queries and reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.<br/>

Prisma provides a type-safe database client, making it easy to interact with the PostgreSQL database and ensuring data integrity.<br/>
<img src='https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2415/PNG/64/postgresql_original_logo_icon_146391.png' style='margin-right: 5px;' width='20px'>[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - A powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its reliability and performance. PostgreSQL is used to store and manage the data for the API.<br/>
<img src='https://jwt.io/img/pic_logo.svg' width='26px'> [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. JWTs are used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, ensuring secure authentication and authorization.<br/>
<img src='https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2415/PNG/64/docker_original_wordmark_logo_icon_146557.png' width='26px'> [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Docker enables you to package your application and its dependencies into a container, ensuring consistency across different environments.<br/>

### Key Features üîë

- **Authentication**: Secure authentication using JWT with support for signin, signup, signout, and token refresh.
- **User Management**: Users can view, update, and delete their own profiles, while public profiles display limited user details and associated recipes.
- **Recipe Management**: Users can perform CRUD operations on their own recipes, with search functionality available for both public and private recipes.
- **Guards**: Protect routes and ensure only authorized users can access specific endpoints using Auth Guard.
- **Search Functionality**: Enables public and private recipe searches by title, description, ingredients, and categories.
- **Security Features**: Implements password hashing, refresh tokens, and access token and access control to protect user data and ensure session security.
- **Database Seeding**: Populate the database with initial user and recipe data for development or testing purposes.

### Authentication & Authorization üîè

- **Secure Authentication**: Users can register and log in to access protected endpoints.
- **JWT-based Authorization**: Ensures only authorized users can access their own recipes and profiles.

### User Management üë•

- **Profile Management**:
  - **Users** can view their own profile with details such as name and email.
  - **Users** can update their profile information, including their name and email.
  - **Users** can delete their account from the platform.
- **Public User Profiles**: Provides access to public user details such as their name and associated recipes.

### Recipe Management üìÑ

- **Create Recipes**: Users can create new recipes with attributes like title, description, ingredients, and categories.
- **Update Recipes**: Users can edit their own recipes.
- **Delete Recipes**: Users can remove their recipes from the database.
- **Search Recipes**: - Search through public recipes on the platform based on various fields (e.g., title, description, ingredients, categories). - Search through user-specific recipes for a personalized experience.

### Guards üõ°Ô∏è

- **Auth Guard**: Ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes by verifying the JWT token in each request.

### Search Functionality üîé

- **Public Recipe Search**: Allows anyone to search for public recipes based on title, description, ingredients, or categories.
- **Private Recipe Search**: Authenticated users can search through their own recipes, including the ability to filter results by specific criteria such as title or ingredients.

### Security Features üëÆ

- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are hashed to ensure they are not stored in plain text.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Enables secure handling of session management and token refreshes.
- **Access Restrictions**: Enforced access rules to ensure users can only manage their own data.

### Database Seeding üå±

The API includes functionality for seeding the database with initial data. This is useful for setting up a development environment or for testing purposes. The following operations are supported:

#### Seed Command:

To populate your database with initial data, use the following command:

```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```

This command will execute the seed script, allowing you to set up initial data for development or testing purposes. It will have user with email: "**_test_user@example.com_**" and password "**Test123.**" and 3 recipes. If you are running project with Docker, then this script will run on initialization and you can test the the **signIn** endoint with "**Test User**" creadentials provided above.

#### Benefits of Database Seeding:

- **Consistent Development Environment**: Ensures that all developers have the same initial data, reducing discrepancies and bugs.

- **Testing**: Provides a reliable dataset for testing, ensuring that tests are run against known data.

- **Demo Data**: Allows you to quickly set up demo data for presentations or client demonstrations

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikolaJohnny94/nestjs-graphql-prisma-recipes-api.git
   cd nestjs-graphql-prisma-recipes-api
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:**

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=your_db_url
   ```

4. **Run database migrations:**

   ```bash
   npm run prisma:migrate:dev
   ```

5. **Generate Prisma client:**

   ```bash
   npm run prisma:generate
   ```

## Run the project üöÄ

**Start the application:**

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

If you run the project locally, the **API** will be available at **http://localhost:3000/graphql**

## Run the project with Docker üêã

**Set up environment variables:**
<br/>Create a **_.env.docker.local_** file in the root directory and add the following _variables_:

```bash
POSTGRES_USER=your_db_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
DATABASE_URL=your_db_url
```

**Build the images:**

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.docker.local build
```

**Creating and starting the containers:**

```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env.docker.local up
```

If you run the project locally, the **API** will be available on **http://localhost/graphql** thanks to the [**_nginx_**](https://nginx.org/en/) that is set up as service in _docker-compose_ file. **Nginx** acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests from **http://localhost/** to **http://localhost/3000** running inside the **Docker** container. This setup allows you to access your **API** through a single, consistent **URL**, even if the underlying services are running on different ports.
